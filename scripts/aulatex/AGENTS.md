# AulaTeX agentic architecture

## Purpose

AulaTeX is a local multimodule editorial agent for institutional LaTeX work.
It adapts useful production patterns from the local reference project:

`D:\Documentos\t-books\proyectos-traducidos\30-Agents-Every-AI-Engineer-Must-Build-main_es_semantic-safe`

The app does not import that project at runtime. The patterns are implemented
inside AulaTeX so the suite remains autonomous.

## Integrated patterns

- Chapter 05: planning agent and memory-augmented agent.
- Chapter 07: tool-using agent, safe invocation, stateful workflow and audit trail.
- Chapter 08: verification and validation agent.
- Chapter 15: collective intelligence, weighted consensus and adversarial critic.

## AulaTeX roles

- Planificador editorial: turns the target into an executable editorial plan.
- Investigador documental: detects institutional context, bibliography and gaps.
- Arquitecto de plantillas: proposes report, presentation and activity structures.
- Verificador y validador: checks evidence, compilation and acceptance criteria.
- Critico adversarial: finds blockers before applying changes.

## Runtime outputs

Each agent run writes:

- `stage-*.md`: one LLM role output per stage.
- `workflow-trace.md`: state-machine audit.
- `shared-memory.md`: memory accumulated during the cycle.
- `agentic-patterns.md`: pattern catalog for the run.
- `manifest.json`: machine-readable run contract.
- `reporte-aulatex.md`: editorial report.

## Safety

- Never commit `scripts/aulatex.env`.
- Never hardcode credentials.
- Keep LLM calls routed through `AulaTeXLLMClient`.
- Keep fragile tools wrapped through `safe_invoke` or `graceful_fallback`.
